            <p>
                Hello World!
            </p>
            <p>
              I&apos;m Tyler McGue, a software engineer and problem-solver based in the Greater Los Angeles area. My journey into tech was unconventional&mdash;I hold a BA in History but quickly transitioned into software development through self-teaching and hands-on projects. This unique path allows me to approach problems with a fresh perspective, blending analytical thinking with curiosity-driven engineering.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the years, I&apos;ve built and optimized <strong>12+ web applications</strong>, automated workflows saving <strong>80+ labor hours per project</strong>, and developed solutions that enhance efficiency by <strong>20% or more</strong>. My technical expertise spans <strong>Python, C#, Django, React/Next.js, JavaScript, SQL, and more</strong>, enabling me to create scalable, high-performance applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether I&apos;m designing applications that improve productivity, automating processes, or crafting dynamic user experiences, I thrive on tackling complex challenges with creative solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m exploring emerging technologies, refining my skills, or spending time with family. Let&apos;s connect&mdash;I&apos;d love to collaborate on exciting opportunities!
