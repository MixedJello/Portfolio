            <p>
                Hello World!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am Tyler McGue, a passionate engineer and creative problem-solver based in the Greater Los Angeles area of California. I didn&apos;t find my passion for tech until after I graduated college, so don&apos;t be so jealous of my BA in History, resulting in my self-taught journey in the exciting field of tech. Due to my unique career path, I bring a one-of-a-kind perspective to technology, blending analytical thinking with a curiosity of how things work. Over the years, I&apos;ve honed my technical expertise in languages and frameworks like Python, C#, Django, React/Next.js, JavaScript, and SQL, while delivering innovative, user-focused solutions. 
            </p>
            <p>Solving problems with creative ideas is what I thrive on. Whether I am building applications that improve efficiencies or crafting client websites, my passion is the ever-present challenging aspect programming brings.</p>
            <p>When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, refining my craft, or enjoying time with my family. Let&apos;s connect&#8213;I&apos;d love to be apart of any new exciting opportunities!</p>
